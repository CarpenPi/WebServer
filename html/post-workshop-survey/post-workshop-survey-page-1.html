Consent to Participate in Research The Carpentries Post-Workshop Survey
</p><p>
Introduction and Purpose My name is Erin Becker and I am the Associate Director of The Carpentries. Thank you for volunteering to take part in our research study, which is about understanding the effectiveness of our workshops. To participate in the study, you will complete a short survey about your skills and perspectives related to our workshop content before and after your workshop. The survey is 16 questions long and will take approximately 5-10 minutes to complete.
</p><p>
Confidentiality Your responses will be recorded anonymously. You will be asked to create a unique identifier. If you completed a pre-workshop survey, please use the same unique identifier. Additionally, these anonymous and aggregate responses will be shared with workshop Hosts, Instructors, Helpers, and The Carpentries Core Team for the purpose of understanding the learners’ experiences, improving future workshops and providing in-depth feedback to allow Instructors to reflect their teaching strategies.
</p><p>
Risks and Benefits There are no direct risks or benefits to you from filling out this survey, and no compensation. We hope to use these results to improve workshops for future learners.
</p><p>
Consent You are not required to take this survey to participate in our workshop. You may quit the survey at any time or skip any item other than those required to correctly sort your responses.
