Consent to Participate in Research The Carpentries Pre-Workshop Survey
</p>
<p>
<span class="it">Introduction and Purpose</span> My name is Erin Becker and I am the Associate Director of The Carpentries. Thank you for volunteering to take part in our research study, which is about understanding the effectiveness of our workshops. To participate in the study, you will complete a short survey about your skills and perspectives related to our workshop content before and after your workshop. Depending on your location, the survey will be 16-18 questions long and will take approximately 5-10 minutes to complete.
</p><p>
<span class="it">Confidentiality</span> Your responses will be recorded anonymously. Additionally, you will be asked to create a unique identifier. This identifier will be confidential to you and will help us compare your results with the post-survey. Your anonymous and aggregate responses will be shared with workshop Hosts, Instructors, Helpers, and The Carpentries Core Team for the purpose of understanding the learners experiences, improving future workshops and providing in-depth feedback to allow Instructors to reflect their teaching strategies.
</p><p>
<span class="it">Risks and Benefits</span> There are no direct risks or benefits to you from filling out this survey, and no compensation. We hope to use these results to improve workshops for future learners.
</p><p>
<span class="it">Consent</span> You are not required to take this survey to participate in our workshop. You may quit the survey at any time or skip any item other than those required to correctly sort your responses.
