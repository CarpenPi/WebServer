			<header><h1>Become an instructor</h1></header>
			<p>If there are no carpentry instructors in your country, you can easily become one yourself in two simple steps.</p>

			<h2>Step 1: Take the Instructor Training Course</h2>
			<p>This training course is <em>two</em> days long. It covers the <em>basics</em> of <i>educational psychology, instructional design</i>, and how to apply both to teaching workshops for The Carpentries.</p>
			<p>Fill out the application <a href="#">here</a>.</p>

			<h3>Instructor Training Goals</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduce you to evidence-based best-practices of teaching</li>
				<li>Teach you how to create a positive environment for learners at your workshops</li>
				<li>Provide opportunities for you to practice and build your teaching skills</li>
				<li>Help you become integrated into the Carpentries community</li>
				<li>Prepare you to use these teaching skills in teaching Carpentries workshops</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The class will be hands-on throughout: short lessons will alternate with individual and group practical exercises, including practice teaching sessions.</p>
			<p><em>Note:</em></p>
			<ul>
				<li>All participants in this course are required to abide by our Code of Conduct</li>
				<li>Though there are <em>no specific pre-requistes</em> for this training, the trainees are neither taught programming in R or Python, use of Git or SQL, or any of the other topics taught in Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, or Library Carpentry workshops; nor how to create your own lessons from scratch</li>
				<li>Therefore, it is recommended to <em>attend</em> Data Carpentry, Software Carpentry, or Library Carpentry workshop either as learner or helper so that they are familiar with our teaching techniques and the style of our workshops</li>
				<li>In conclusion, participants are <em>not</em> required to have any specific programming skills, though they should know enough about the subjects of one or more of our lessons to be able to teach them</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Sample Schedule</h3>
			<img src="/assets/img/sample-schedule.png" alt="Example training course schedule" width="913" height="594">
			<p>The actual schedule may vary slightly depending on the topics and exercises chosen by the instructor.</p>

			<h2>Step 2: Checkout Procedure</h2>
			<p>After you have completed the two-day instructor training workshop, you will proceed to the checkout procedure.</p>
			<p>You are provided with a maximum of three months to complete the tasks. Extension may be requested <a href="#">on this link</a>.</p>
			<p>Certificate of Completion is provided two weeks after all tasks have been completed.</p>
			<p>The tasks include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Make (and send us a link to) a contribution to a lesson or glossary</li>
				<li>Take part in an online community discussion session</li>
				<li>Teach a short demonstration lesson online. (There is no particular order to do these tasks)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Details of each task can be viewed <a href="#">here</a>.</p>

			<h3>Aim of Tasks: Introduction to Key Components of being a Carpentries instructor</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Contributing to our materials. As our materials are developed by the community, we want to ensure that all instructors know where and how to contribute to them, particularly so that you can contribute in the future.</li>
				<li>Participating in the larger Carpentry instructor community. We include the community discussion session in the checkout because we hear from many instructors that one of their favorite aspects of being a Carpentry instructor is meeting and talking with other instructors in the community.</li>
				<li>Practicing and confirming the skills you need to teach on your own. Before signing up for a workshop, you will have practiced preparing a lesson and doing a brief session of live coding.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Once all steps have been successfully completed you will recieve your your certificate, and instructions on how to add yourself to the teaching roster and our website.</p>
			<p>If for any reason the trainer leading the session feels that you should try again, you will be told what to focus on and when and where to sign up for another session.</p>
			<p>If you have any questions, please <a href="#">contact us</a>.</p>
